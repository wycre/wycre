# About Me

- ðŸ‘¥ Looking to collaborate on projects
- ðŸ«‚ Not currently looking for a job/internship, but still will accept offers
- Enrolled at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs
- Major in Computer Science
- Interest in networking and cybersecurity

Since I was in high school, I formed an interest in computers and computing. Many of my family and friends looked to me to solve problems related to technology. This and my natural passion to solve problems guided me into a career in tech.

As I continued to learn and develop my skills, computer networks became particular interest of mine. I enjoy the prospect of managing a large network of devices, and being able to fix any issues that arise. Recently, I have had the opportunity to become familiar with and work on large networks and autonomous systems.

I spend some of my spare time maintaining my homelab, where I host websites, public archives, file/media servers, and game servers. As well as improving my knowledge and skills related to computer networks and Cybersecurity.
